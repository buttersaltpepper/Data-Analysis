## ðŸ“– Projects

1. **[Stock Options Dashboard for Australian eChallenge](https://buttersaltpepper-finapp-app-cfhlmv.streamlit.app/)**: My pitch for the 2022 eChallenge was a dashboard to track US stock options greek exposures and cluster stocks for portfolio diversification, providing valuable insights for risk management.

2. **[Housing Price Exploratory Data Analysis](Python_HousingPriceEDA/EDA_Housing_Price.ipynb)**: Used Python for univariate and bivariate statistics to study the relationship between the features and housing prices. Used stepwise backward selection to determine which variables were the most influential to guide further analysis.

3. **[Hedging a Gold Stock Portfolio with Futures (pdf)](Python_Finance/HedgingMarketRisk.pdf)**: Python was used to conduct investment data analysis and calculate the beta hedge ratio using statsmodels, and visualise findings using matplotlib

4. **[Relationship between CO2 and World Happiness Score](R_co2_vs_happiness/happiness_vs_co2.md)**: Aimed to understand the factors that contribute to happiness in countries and investigated the potential impact of CO2 use on population happiness. The analysis was performed using R and hypothesis tests were applied to draw the connections between CO2 use and happier countries.
